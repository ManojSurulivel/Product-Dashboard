*Product Dashboard 

Description:

This project is a Product Dashboard built with React, which allows users to view a list of products, filter them by categories, search by product name, and sort them by price. It is responsive across all devices and includes pagination and error handling for API failures.

*Key Features:

*Product Listing: Displays a list of products with details such as name, price, description, and category, fetched from a mock API.

*Filtering and Search: Users can filter products by category and search products by name.

*Product Details: Clicking on a product navigates to a Product Details page with more detailed information.

*Sorting: Provides sorting options to sort products by price (ascending or descending).

*State Management: Uses React Hooks (useState, useEffect) and Context API for managing global state.

*Pagination: Displays pagination when the number of products exceeds 10 per page.

*Responsive Design: Works well across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

*Error Handling: Gracefully handles API failures by displaying user-friendly error messages.
